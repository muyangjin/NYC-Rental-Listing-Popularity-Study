# NYC Rental Listing Popularity Study

This project focus on designing a more reasonable listing mechanism that can predict the inter-
est level (high, medium, low) of rental apartments
based on their numerical and descriptive information. We approached it using logistic regression,
random forest, and kNN. The results show that
random forest has the best performance in predicting the popularity of rental apartments.

The project is the final project for NYU DS-GA 1007 Programming for Data Science
